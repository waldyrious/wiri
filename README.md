# [Live demo](http://waldyrious.net/wiri/)

This repository is a partial clone of Magnus Manske's 
[Tools from Toolserver](https://bitbucket.org/magnusmanske/magnus-toolserver/),
which contains [Wiri](https://tools.wmflabs.org/magnus-toolserver/thetalkpage/) and other tools.

So far I couldn't manage to get it to run fully as a local site,
so you will need a server for it to work properly.
The simplest way is using Python: do `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
and then load http://localhost:8000 in a browser.
Hopefully I'll figure out how to get it to work completely client-side :)
